This repository only exists to enable GitHub Pages to redirect from URLs we shared
before we switched to `geojupyter.org`.

When someone reports a previously-shared `geojupyter.github.io` link is broken, this
repo should be updated to un-break that link. Other than that, this repo shouldn't
need to be changed.

See: <https://github.com/geojupyter/geojupyter.org>
